# Library dirac.js

This javascript library provides a class `dirac()` for
quantummechanical computations in Dirac notation (with bra and ket
vectors forming brackets and operators).

For documentation, see the source file `dirac.js`. For a
demonstration, visit the [Quantum Calculator with Dirac
Notation](https://pyramids.github.io/diracjs/) in your browser. [Unit
tests](https://pyramids.github.io/diracjs/test.html) are also
accessible with your browser.
